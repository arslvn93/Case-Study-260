He showed us exactly what we could afford, took us through homes so we could see what was realistic, and then adjusted the plan based on what we actually needed—not just what we thought we wanted. We didn't think we'd be able to get such a beautiful house with an amazing backyard, but his strategy made it possible. He put our interests first every step of the way, and now we have our forever home where our family can grow.\"<br><span>— Satisfied Client</span>"

They wanted someone who would map out the entire journey, not just unlock doors."
